3. Architecture
3.1 MVT Pattern
The project follows Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture:

Model: Defines the data structure. In this project, models represent Users, Tickets, and Bookings.
View: Contains the business logic and interacts with the model to carry data to the template.
Template: Renders the data for the user interface.
3.2 Component Interaction
[Client] <---> [URLs] <---> [Views] <---> [Models] <---> [Database]
Client: Makes HTTP requests to the API.
URLs: Routes the requests to the appropriate view.
Views: Processes the request, interacts with models, and returns a response.
Models: Represents the data and handles database interactions.
Database: Stores the data.
